# HAMOYE-THIRD-QUIZ---MACHINE-LEARNING-CLASSIFICATION
Following the instructions, I have written some code to answer some of the questions in the Hamoye Class C Quiz.
All libraries were imported and the codes ran successfully

NOTE: xgboost library used was the version 0.90 as the new version indicated some errors in the y_train set
